# practice_pull

Practice cloning, creating a branch, and pushing code to branch. 
As well as creating a pull request.

Clone the Repository:
Open your terminal or command prompt and use the following command to clone the GitHub repository to your local machine. Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL of the repository.

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the Repository:
Change your current directory to the newly cloned repository.

bash
Copy code
cd <repository_directory>
Create a New Branch:
Create a new branch for your changes. Replace <branch_name> with a meaningful name for your branch.

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b <branch_name>
This command creates and switches to a new branch.

Make Changes:
Make the necessary changes to the code in your local branch.

Stage and Commit Changes:
Stage your changes and commit them.

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
Push Changes to the Remote Branch:
Push your branch to the remote repository on GitHub.

bash
Copy code
git push origin <branch_name>
This command pushes your local branch to the remote repository.

Create a Pull Request (PR):
Go to the GitHub repository on the web interface, and you should see a prompt to create a pull request for your recently pushed branch. Follow the instructions to create the pull request.

Review and Merge the Pull Request:
If your changes are approved during the pull request review process, you can merge your changes into the main branch. This can typically be done through the GitHub web interface.

Navigate to the pull request on GitHub.
Click on the "Merge" button.
